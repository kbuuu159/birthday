        My dearest love,
      </p>
      <p>
        I could never put into words just how grateful I am to have you in my life — but today, I’ll try.
        From the moment we started talking, everything felt different. Real. Easy. Magical.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the kindest, funniest, smartest, most stupidly handsome human I know. Being with you feels like home and adventure all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for always showing up with your full heart. Thank you for loving me so effortlessly. Thank you for just being YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today’s your birthday — but you’re the real gift in this world. And I hope this little website reminded you how loved, admired, and *completely worshipped* you are. 😘
      </p>
      <p>
        With all the love in the world,<br>
        <strong>Me 🥰</strong>
